# Elite: Dangerous Custom Binding File Reader

A simple library for parsing the `Custom.(version).binds` file containing controller bindings for
the game Elite: Dangerous.

Created so that I could query the state of bindings in other programs, particularly a Unity-based
MFD Controller that I'm toying with.
